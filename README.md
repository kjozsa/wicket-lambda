This is a regular maven project. Just run "mvn package" and deploy it wherever you want.

I used Wicket's archetype to create it, so it does come bundled with a Jetty server. If you're using eclipse, find the "Start" class inside the "src/test/java" and right click on it, and then just click "Run as Java Application".
